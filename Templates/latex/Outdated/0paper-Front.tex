\noindent\textbf{\large Abstract}

\noindent\textsl{%
This paper quantifies features of the changing world economy relevant
for small, open northern European states.  The paper calibrates shifts
in the global distribution of economic activity along three distinct
dimensions: first, in the world's economic centre of gravity; second,
in that distribution's extreme or tail behaviour; and third, in
spatial flows of exports.
How substantial is the rise of the East, and is this rise fragile in 
being driven by trade surpluses against the advanced Western economies?
The evidence suggests the Great Shift East is indeed pronounced but has
features inconsistent with some conventional narratives on global
imbalance.
